# ffxiv-auto-login
Use this to open FFXIV, put in your username and password, hit login, and hit "play".
Passwords are base64 encrypted. Better than having your password lay around in plain text.

## Installation
1. Install Python3 (Preferably 3.10)
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Edit config.json. To base64 encode your password (required), use https://www.base64decode.org/
4. Launch with 'py login.py'

## Will this get me banned?
Probably not. But who knows? :)

## Is my password safe?
Probably safe from your little brother. Definitely not safe against anyone who knows what base64 is.

## Why should I trust this then?
Laziness, maybe? Or, perhaps, the fact this is open source and you can literally see what it's doing.
